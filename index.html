    <p>The concept is simple: yellow T-shirts, instruments of all kinds, and above all, huge smiles. 
      We bring nothing. Or rather, joy. Our tool is cheap: music. 
      Music is unbeatable when it comes to language differences. 
      Music is unbeatable when it comes to awakening deep-seated smiles. 
      Music is the perfect alibi to start a conversation without embarrassment: "What's your favorite music?"
      In short, we're not here to provide food or clothing, but to do what's right for everyone: sing, dance, and bring a little joy to the loneliness of the homeless<p>
